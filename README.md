# Weather-Forecast
Swift Training Day 2 : Weather Forecast U.I

Structures represent a fundamental activity in programming: reusing common patterns of code. By creating a custom ForecastCard structure, you grouped the view’s code and related data, saving yourself time and reducing the potential for error.
Structures are general-purpose tools for organizing any type of code. As a developer, you’ll need to store, display, send, and receive data in your apps. You’ll use structures to create models for this data (Apple Developer).

# Topics and skills covered
- Using a structure to make a custom view
- Creating instances using a structure’s initializer
- Customizing each instance of a structure using properties
- The String, Int, and Bool data types
- Computed properties, which change data based on a condition
